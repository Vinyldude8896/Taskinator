# Taskinator


### User Story

As a user looking with a busy schedule, I would like an application that allows me to see, track, add, update, edit and delete my tasks. This will help me track and oraganize all my tasks. When I am on the homepage, I am presented with a toolbar where I can enter a new task. When I am looking at my existing tasks, I can see the To Do section, the In progress section and the completed section.

### Features
This app allows you to track your tasks
This app allows you to add a new task, edit or delete a task.
This also alllows you to change the status to In Progress or Completed, which then moves it to the appropriate container.
